# MediaFox

MediaFox is a web application for browsing movies and TV shows. With MediaFox, users can search for movies and TV shows, view information about them, and play trailers.

## How It Works

MediaFox is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch information about movies and TV shows.

When a user searches for a movie or TV show, MediaFox sends a request to the TMDb API and displays the search results on the page. The user can then click on a search result to view more information about the movie or TV show, including the title, release date, rating, and overview. The user can also play the trailer for the movie or TV show.

## How to Use MediaFox

To use MediaFox, simply open the application in a web browser and search for a movie or TV show using the search bar. Click on a search result to view more information about the movie or TV show, and click the "Watch Trailer" button to play the trailer.

## Installation

To run MediaFox locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
